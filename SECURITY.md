### Example Security Report

```markdown
## XSS Vulnerability in Atom Persistence

**Severity**: High

**Component**: Persistence mechanism

**Description**: 
The persistence feature does not properly sanitize data when reading from localStorage, 
potentially allowing stored XSS attacks if malicious data is injected into localStorage 
by another script.

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Create a persisted atom
2. Manually inject malicious script into localStorage key
3. Refresh page - malicious script executes

**Impact**: 
Could allow XSS attacks if localStorage is compromised by other scripts.

**Suggested Fix**: 
Add data validation and sanitization when reading from storage.
```

## ⚡ Response Process

### Our Commitment

When you report a security vulnerability, we commit to:

1. **Acknowledge receipt** within 48 hours
2. **Provide initial assessment** within 1 week
3. **Keep you informed** of progress throughout the process
4. **Credit you** in the security advisory (if desired)

### Response Timeline

| Stage | Timeline | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Acknowledgment | 48 hours | We confirm receipt of your report |
| Initial Assessment | 1 week | We evaluate the severity and impact |
| Investigation | 1-2 weeks | We investigate and develop a fix |
| Fix Development | 1-2 weeks | We create and test the security patch |
| Release | ASAP | We release the fix and security advisory |
| Disclosure | After fix | Public disclosure with credit |

### Severity Classification

We classify security vulnerabilities using the following criteria:

#### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data exfiltration at scale

#### High  
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Privilege escalation
- Significant data exposure

#### Medium
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- CSRF vulnerabilities

#### Low
- Minor information leaks
- Edge case vulnerabilities
- Theoretical attacks

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using Nucleus State in your applications:

#### 1. Validate Persisted Data
```tsx
const createSecureAtom = (initialValue, key) => {
  return createAtom(initialValue, {
    persist: key,
    validator: (data) => {
      // Add your validation logic
      return isValidData(data);
    }
  });
};
```

#### 2. Sanitize User Input
```tsx
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const userInputAtom = createAtom('');

// Sanitize before storing
const setUserInput = (input) => {
  const sanitized = DOMPurify.sanitize(input);
  setAtomValue(userInputAtom, sanitized);
};
```

#### 3. Use Content Security Policy
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" 
      content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'">
```

#### 4. Regular Updates
- Keep Nucleus State updated to the latest version
- Monitor our security advisories
- Review your dependencies regularly

### For Contributors

When contributing to Nucleus State:

#### 1. Security Review
- Consider security implications of new features
- Review code for potential vulnerabilities
- Add security tests where appropriate

#### 2. Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Audit new dependencies for security issues
- Use `npm audit` regularly

#### 3. Secure Coding Practices

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before using Nucleus State in production:

- [ ] Updated to latest version
- [ ] No sensitive data in atoms
- [ ] Persisted data is validated
- [ ] User inputs are sanitized
- [ ] CSP headers are configured
- [ ] Regular security audits scheduled
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive info

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Browser Storage Limitations
- **localStorage/sessionStorage** can be accessed by any script on the page
- **Data persists** across browser sessions
- **No encryption** by default

### Mitigation Strategies
- Only persist non-sensitive data
- Implement custom encryption if needed
- Use short expiration times for sensitive data
- Validate data integrity
